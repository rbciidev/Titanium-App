Diabetwatch vs. Diabetes
 
Diabetes is a condition, wherein blood glucose levels are above normal. Most of the food we eat is converted into glucose, or sugar, which our bodies use for energy. The pancreas, an organ that lies near the stomach, produces a hormone called insulin to help glucose get into the cells of our bodies.
 
When a person has diabetes, the body either does not manufacture enough insulin, or cannot use its own insulin as it should. This condition causes sugar to build up in the blood. This disease can create negative health complications, which include heart disease, blindness, kidney failure, and lower-extremity amputations. Diabetes is considered as the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. And according to Francisco Pasaporte, President of the Philippine Association of Diabetes Educators, 500 Filipinos are being diagnosed with diabetes everyday (as of June 2008).
