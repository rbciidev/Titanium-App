Pinkish Glow
Lycopene is what gives rose its pinkish colour. It’s also naturally found in human skin but gets depleted over time.  Lycopene belongs to the family of intensely coloured anti-oxidants known as Carotenoids, which are found within the lipid layers of the skin.  It plays a major role in skin health and influences the colour of your skin. Lycopene may be the best free radical scavenger among carotens - it is at least twice as effective antioxidant as beta carotene.
 
Health Benefits
 
• Fighting Cancer – Several studies found that eating vegetables rich in Lycopene, such as tomatoes or tomato-based products, may reduce the risk of getting cancer. Carotenoids work to protect against cancer and aging related diseases by acting as an antioxidant to counteract damaging effects of free radicals in tissue.
 
• Preventing heart diseases – Lycopene is found to prevent oxidation of lipids and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) and reduces the risk of a person developing atherosclerosis and coronary heart diseases.
 
• Keeping skin healthy - Lycopene may help reduce the damage to the skin caused by UV light during and after sun exposure. Lycopene has the ability to quench free radicals, which are highly reactive compounds that are formed in the body from normal metabolism. As well as from environmental pollutants and radiation.
