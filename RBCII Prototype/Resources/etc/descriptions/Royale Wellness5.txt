Why do we need Sodium Ascorbate?
 
The GLO Gene is absent in many people. Scientists believe that this happened around 60 million years ago. The absence of this gene makes us unable to biosynthesize the specific enzyme L- gulonolactone oxidase. This is an end-stage liver enzyme that bio-converts blood glucose to Ascorbate; without it, our bodies cannot produce any Ascorbate.  In the long term, the lack of Ascorbate causes our bones to dissolve and teeth to fall out; in other words, sub-clinical scurvy and a tendency to develop cancer.
 
Ascorbic Acid is produced in large quantities in almost all animals, e.g. 6 grams a day in goat, or up to 100grams daily if the goat is stressed. But it is not the Ascorbic Acid our body requires, rather a SALT of Ascorbic Acid. A daily supplementation of Ascorbate several times a day is a simple way to make up for this genetic defect.
 
Robert F. Cathcart, MD another medical pioneer who has had great success with Ascorbate, successfully treating over 25,000 patients with large doses, often as high as 150gms per day, healing all kinds of chronic degenerative disease.
 
Dr. Klenner UMD, FCCP began his Ascorbate studies in the 40's and treated 30 to 40 patients a day in North Carolina until his death in 1984, treating many degenerative diseases. He also found that treating with Ascorbate during pregnancy resulted in a much healthier mom and baby. If a mother takes high doses of Ascorbate, in addition to other measures such as taking folic acid and avoiding cigarettes and alcohol, she will deliver an extremely healthy baby. Studies have also shown that labour will be quicker and less painful. Giving a child 1 gram of Ascorbate per day up until the age of 10 will bypass all regular childhood diseases including measles, mumps, chicken pox, etc. as well as common airborne infections.
